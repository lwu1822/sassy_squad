        <h1>Getting Started</h1>

        <p>A easy way to write SASS and have it preprocessed into CSS is by using a Jekyll
            powered website, such as GitHub pages or Fastpages.
        </p>
        <p>The first step is to clone a GitHub pages repo, such as this <a href="https://github.com/lwu1822/sassy_squad">one.</a></p>
        <p>Within the repository, head over to <code>assets/css/</code>, and open <code>style.scss</code>.</p>

        <br>
        <img src="imagessass/stylescssLocation.jpg" alt="style.scss location">

        <br>
        <p>The file looks something like this:</p>

        <img src="imagessass/stylescssFile.jpg" alt="style.scss file">
        <p>This is where you can create your SASS code.</p>

        <br>
        <p>To see your CSS-translated SASS code, head over to <code>_site/assets/css/style.css</code></p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> You will need to run <code>bundle exec jekyll serve</code> before 
            the <code>_site</code> directory appears.</p>
        <p>The first few hundred lines are used to style Github's theme. Make sure to scroll to the
             very bottom to see the SASS code that you wrote, which is in the form of CSS.</p>
